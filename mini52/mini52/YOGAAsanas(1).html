<br>
<h1 ><b>Can PCOS be Cured by Yoga?</b></h1>

<p>This is one of the most common questions asked by women suffering from PCOD. Several studies and researches have proven that yoga cannot cure PCOS, but it is a great way of managing PCOS symptoms. Performing Yoga asanas for PCOD every day may:<br>

1.Lower testosterone levels in the female body<br>
2.Activate de-stressing hormones and relax your body<br>
3.Be a useful method for reducing anxiety<br>
4.Aid with the overall management of chronic health concerns by reducing chronic pain<br>
5.Help in improving blood circulation and balancing blood sugar levels (which are otherwise found to be on a higher side among PCOD patients)<br><br>

<b><h2>Conclusion</h2></b><br>

Yoga will not treat PCOS. In truth, no drug can cure PCOS. Yoga, on the other hand, can considerably lessen the symptoms of PCOS, particularly those that influence fertility, and can also minimize your need for tablets or medicine to regulate your hormones. Follow the above-mentioned yoga poses for PCOD to head towards a healthy lifestyle.<br>
