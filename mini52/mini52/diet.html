<br>
PCOS diet is a crucial role in the management of PCOS, not only for weight loss and maintenance but also to regulate insulin levels. Many women with PCOS are resistant to insulin, resulting in the pancreas producing more insulin in order to be effective.
<br>
Insulin is an important hormone as it transports sugar from the blood into the muscles of the body, allowing the body to effectively make use of the energy from glucose.
<br>
 High insulin levels wreak havoc on the body, leading to a lot of the symptoms of PCOS like, increased hair growth, weight gain, acne, fatty liver, and high cholesterol, polycystic ovaries, and an irregular menstrual cycle, not to mention increased hunger levels and cravings.


<br>
Two of the primary ways that diet affects PCOS are weight management and insulin production and resistance.
insulin plays a significant role in PCOS, so managing insulin levels with a PCOS diet is one of the best thing to solve the POCs problem.




<br>
<b>Three diets that may help people with PCOS manage their symptoms are:</b>

<h2>A low glycemic index (GI) diet: </h2>The body digests foods with a low GI more slowly, meaning they do not cause insulin levels to rise as much or as quickly as other foods, such as some carbohydrates. Foods in a low GI diet include <ul><li>whole grains</li><li>legumes</li><li>nuts</li><li>seeds</li><li>fruits</li><li>starchy vegetables</li><li>low-carbohydrate foods.</li></ul>

 <b>
    
The Glycemic load (GL)</b>
it is a better measure of the type of carbohydrates as
compared to glycemic index. As it takes into account both the quality and quantity
of carbohydrates. The glycemic load is the measure of increase in blood sugar levels
after eating one serving of that particular food.
Similar to the glycemic index, the glycemic load of a food can be classified as low,
medium, or high:<br>
Low: 10 or less<br>
Medium: 11-19<br>
High: 20 or more
</p>

How to calculate Glycemic Load?<br>
The formula for calculating the GL of a particular food or meal is:<br>
Glycemic Load = GI x Carbohydrate (in grams) in per serving / 100<br>
For example, a single apple has a GI of 38 and contains 13 grams of carbohydrates.<br>
GL= 38 x 13/100 = 5<br>
Which means the glycemic Load of apple is low.
<br>

<b> Tips for maintaining a Healthy Diet and incorporating the GI and GL
index into your daily routine:</b>

<h2>An anti-inflammatory diet: </h2>Inflammation plays a role in PCOS.1 Compared to women of the same weight, women with PCOS have higher levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and white blood cell count.2

While dietary modifications can't completely reduce inflammation in the body, diet plays a role in inflammation. Certain foods are part of an anti-inflammatory diet, while others have been shown to promote inflammation.<br>
Some foods can induce high levels of insulin, oxidative stress, and cause weight gain—all of which stimulate an inflammatory response. Research shows that modifying your diet to reduce inflammation can have a beneficial effect on PCOS.
<br>
Anti-inflammatory foods, such as berries, fatty fish, leafy greens, and extra virgin olive oil, may reduce inflammation-related symptoms, such as fatigue.

salmon
sardines
herring
mackerel
anchovies

<h2>The DASH diet:</h2> 
DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH diet is a healthy-eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure (hypertension).<br>Doctors often recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to reduce the risk or impact of heart disease. It may also help manage PCOS symptoms. A DASH diet is rich in fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables whole grain, and low-fat dairy produce. The diet discourages foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar.<br>
DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH diet is a healthy-eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure (hypertension).

<h2>Don'ts for  PCOS</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li>Don’t have refined carbohydrates: Foods such as white breads, pastries, muffins, and white potatoes exacerbate insulin resistance and cause inflammation which will worsen your PCOS symptoms.</li>

<br><li>Don’t have sugary snacks or drinks: Excess sugar is one of the main causes of insulin resistance and should be avoided at all costs. When checking food labels, look for the other names of sugar such as sucrose, dextrose, and high fructose corn syrup.</li>
<li>Don’t have inflammatory foods: These foods exacerbate PCOS symptoms. Foods such as French fries, margarine, red meat, and other processed meats belong to this group and should be avoided as much as possible.</li><li>Do not smoke.</li><li>Do not consume alcohol.</li>
.<li>Do not skip meals or sleep. A disciplined lifestyle is key to better health and freedom from PCOS.<br></li><li>Avoid Hormonal treatment as far as possible</li>
