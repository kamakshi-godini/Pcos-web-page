<h1 ><b>What is the reason for PCOS</b></h1>
<p>
The exact cause of PCOS is unknown. There is evidence that genetics play a role. Several other factors also play a role in causing PCOS:<br> 
<b>Higher levels of male hormones called androgens</b>: High androgen levels prevent the ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation), which causes irregular menstrual cycles. Irregular ovulation can also cause small, fluid-filled sacs to develop in the ovaries. High androgen also causes acne and excess hair growth in women.<br>
<b>Insulin resistance</b>: Increased insulin levels cause the ovaries to make and release male hormone (androgens). Increased male hormone, in turn, suppress ovulation and contribute to other symptoms of PCOS. Insulin controls the way your body processes glucose (sugar) and uses it for energy. Insulin resistance means your body doesn't process insulin correctly, leading to high glucose levels in your blood. Not all individuals with insulin resistance have an elevated glucose or diabetes, but insulin resistance can lead to diabetes. Being overweight or having obesity can also contribute to insulin resistance. An elevated insulin level, even if your blood glucose is normal, can indicate insulin resistance.<br>
<b>Low-grade inflammation</b>: People with PCOS tend to have chronic low-grade inflammation. Your healthcare provider can perform blood tests that measure levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells, which can indicate the level of inflammation in your body.<br></p>
